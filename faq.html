                Incompatibility. <br>The new versions of ClickCrystals has a new
                feature called Discord RPC. This essentially displays your acitivies
                on discord presence. Because the API that we use only supports Linux
                and Windows, ClickCrystals has become incompatible with MacOS and
                Pojav. <br>Here's how you can solve this:
              </p>
              <p>Get off Mac</p>
              <ul>
                <li>ClickCrystals is not compatible with MacOS.</li>
                <li>
                  If you have enough money to afford a MacOS, with the same money you
                  could buy a real computer 10x better. Apple is a scam and you should
                  hop off.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Get a real PC</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Why play Java on phone? It's incompatible now!</li>

              <div class="accordion-body">In around May of 2023, our mod ClickCrystals, developed by ImproperIssues (aka ItziSpyder), has been stolen by a person with the alias of L0rax or Niksa_. This person proceeded to inject malicious code that grabs your Microsoft account, Skyblock information, and IP then sends them to a Discord webhook.

                L0rax has commited identity theft and advertised ClickCrystals as his own mod on CurseForge. Luckily, after a few months of fighting, the duplicate mod was taken down and the webhook was nuked and destroyed. 7 months later, we have decided that the situation on CurseForge has calmed down enough for us to reupload our mod to the site.

              <div class="accordion-body">Short answer, no.

                Long answer, it is not a cheat. It does not automate any task, for every action the mod preforms, you have to click or interact with something. The definition of macro is doing a task without the player inputting anything. This is false. Unless a player creates a macro with ClickCrystals script, the mod itself does not provide any unfair advantages.</div>

                While we believe ClickCrystals doesn't provide any unfair game
                advantages, the world does not. Servers WILL ban you if they find out
                you are using this mod. Best way to prevent this from happening is to
                not get screenshared. We have provided multiple approaches to this:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The mod does not flag anticheat</li>
                <li>The mod looks like normal gameplay in third person view</li>
                <li>
                  The mod, unless errors and stacktraces, has its own custom log file
                  seperate from the vanilla one; can be easily deleted
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you still possess older versions of ClickCrystals, you may have
                heard of the command !cc -users. This command was once added as a fun
                easter egg, which has later caused a disaster leading to its removal
                in later versions. Servers can use this to force ban you, be sure to
                update your version!
