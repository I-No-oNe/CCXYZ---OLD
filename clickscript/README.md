# ClickCrystals Wiki

Welcome to the ClickCrystals Wiki! Here, we answer you frequently asked questions and also documentate our scripting language.

## About
The ClickCrystals Project is a free and open-source Minecraft client modification that allows all-in-one features without you having to download a lot of mods.

While ClickCrystals mainly supports hotkeying, the concept has sparked debates amongst the crystal pvp community. Currently, the mod is banned on most servers, but is not flaggable by anticheat.

ClickCrystals Team also worked to release a scripting language for minecraft called ClickCrystal Scripts. With ClickCrystals, you are able to write, run and save CCS Scripts, come code your own plugins!

## Setting up
> Opening the editor menu and setting up.

### Opening the ClickCrystals Menu
Apostrophe key. If you don't know what it is, you're a third grader that shouldn't be play games and should be studying instead.

A menu would open. It is called as the ClickCrystals Menu. Click "Browse Modules" then. Switch to the "Custom Scripts" at sidebar.

There you go, this is simple to create a ClickScript file. Continue for now.


## A bit info

Having some earlier knowledge of Python or JavaScript is really good. ClickCrystal Scripts are easy to understand just as speaking.

Also, to make the documentation shorter, we will sometimes call CC - that means ClickCrystals. And, CCS means CCScript.
