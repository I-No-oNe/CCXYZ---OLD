# CCS Script Files
All CCS modules should be in CCS script files. Script files are read from the folder `.minecraft/ClickCrystalsClient/scripts/`, so it is crucial to create your CCS script files there. All CCS script files should have the file name extension `.ccs` or *they will be skipped*.

You can have more than one CCS modules all in one CCS script file, but it is recommended to create them separately for organization and tidiness.
