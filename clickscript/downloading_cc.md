# Downloading ClickCrystals
Hyped up and ready to script? Let’s download the mod itself!

To download ClickCrystals, you must first acknowledge the fake copies that exist on the internet out there. When things like this happen, it is least likely that someone is using the name of ClickCrystals to get their name out there; most of the time it is someone taking advantage of <70 IQ people to download their infected software.

Be sure that you only download the **.jar** from trusted sources. We would encourage most users to download our project on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/clickcrystals). If you don’t trust the CurseForge site, you can always visit [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/clickcrystals), but it is not recommended due to content rule compatibility issues and has been discontinued.

If you are a developer and would rather build the jar yourself, ClickCrystals is a free and open source software on [GitHub](https://github.com/itzispyder/clickcrystals).
