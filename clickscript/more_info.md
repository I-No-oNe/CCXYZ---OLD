# More Information
CCS is an interpreted script language, meaning that it determines what each execution does before it runs and does not require compilation. This allows ClickCrystals users to easily reload or run their scripts in game.

All ClickCrystal scripts are run first thing upon game launch. This either includes the creation of new modules or other tasks such as saving the config or printing something into the console. If you want to execute scripts after launch, you can run the command `,ccs compile <your script>`. If you want to execute a script file, `,ccs run <file path>`.

*All script files must have a file extension of .ccs or .txt. If the file does not have either one of these extensions, they will be skipped.*
