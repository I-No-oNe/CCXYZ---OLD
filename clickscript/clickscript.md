# What's ClickScript
aka ClickScript or CCS- a fast and easy way to create modules from simple swapping, to selective interactions in game! CCS consists of a lot of CCS commands, and can be either executed separately or together in a .ccs file, like a Minecraft datapack!

Not enough modules? Your wonderful ideas aren't getting accepted? Want private features but don't know how to code? No worries, make your own modules with ClickCrystalsScripts (CCS)!
