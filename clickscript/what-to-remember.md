# What to remember
Before programming a CC Script, we strongly recommend you to follow these guidelines:

 When told CC is a cheat because of CCS, simply say:
> *The distributed version of CC does not include any unfair advantages. Upon distribution, the people who shared the copies made them into cheats themselves; it is not fair to make a remark on CC's new advantages when people turn them into cheats as the original intention of CCS was to create swap modules as suggested by I-No-oNe . Saying things as such or related as such is equivalent to saying it is not fair some people know how to code in Java and cloned CC's open source repository to add "features" for their own liking.*

Please be aware of any other risks by custom scripts. They might get a temporary or even permanent ban at some reasons. The ClickCrystals Staff is not responsible for any bans by custom scripts.

> If you do not care about bans, then just try to not do a same task with max accuracy all times (like, autototem might get banned, but you can do a random interval reducing the accuracy as well as ban chances).
